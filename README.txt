# Intro

The Nashville City Cemetery project focuses on exploring a dataset of known burials from 1846 through 1979. This dataset provides an informative, historical perspective on the lives, causes of death, and social conditions in Nashville over the years. The project highlights trends in burial demographics, causes of death, and residence data. The project also includes marketing materials that propose collaboration with potential partners like the Nashville Public Library to engage the community and educate "legacy learners".

# Technologies

- Power BI (visualizations)
- Excel (data cleaning and analysis)
- Canva

# Features

- Visualization of the top 10 recorded causes of death, with data cleaning to correct spelling errors and inconsistencies.
- Interactive dashboard showing burials by age, sex, and residence across different decades.
- Conditional formatting to highlight anomalies in burial records based on year, month, and demographic categories.

# Scope

- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends in the historical cemetery records, focusing on key demographic data like age at death, cause of death, and residence.
- Develop community-focused educational materials that promote engagement with Nashville’s history, in collaboration with the Nashville Public Library.
- Highlight historical insights that are relevant to current social issues, such as public health and child safety, while fostering an appreciation for the city’s past.

# Marketing Materials

As part of this project, marketing materials were developed to support a proposed partnership between the Nashville City Cemetery and the Nashville Public Library. This partnership centers on the "Legacy Learner Program", an initiative aimed at providing immersive historical education for children. Highlights include:
1. Living History Tour: A curated tour of the cemetery, offering visitors a glimpse into 150 years of Nashville’s history. The tour promotes historical reflection, with stops such as the grave of President James K. Polk and monuments showcasing Nashville’s diverse past​(Cemetery Project).
2. Legacy Learner Program: This program ties literature from the Nashville Public Library's collection with on-site cemetery visits. Students participate in creative writing workshops, imagining the lives of historical figures buried in the cemetery, thus bringing history to life in a tangible and engaging way. Selected books are from the library’s summer reading list, allowing students to earn rewards while learning​(Cemetery Project).
3. Family-Friendly Events: Interactive activities such as scavenger hunts, Civil War tours, and historical character re-enactments are designed to engage younger visitors and their families. These events highlight important historical moments and figures while making the experience educational and enjoyable for all ages​(Cemetery Project).
4. Gratitude Reflection: Visitors are encouraged to reflect on how society has progressed in areas such as medicine, childhood safety, and quality of life. By exploring grave records, individuals gain a deeper appreciation for modern advances in these areas​(Cemetery Project).
